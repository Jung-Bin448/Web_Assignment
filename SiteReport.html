                        <h1>Site Report</h1>
            
                        <p>This site demonstrates animation, Transition, Colouring, use of Grid, Flex, Opacity. In this Assignment I have implemented every library function that were taught in the class. 
                            This site report shows the progress of my portfolio website for the Web Development module. The main purpose of this website is to show case my knowledge for the HTML and CSS and my creativity for desigining website. 
                            I also took some help from AI and watched some Videos in Youttube to understand the working principle of every function. 
                            I used AI for Hamburger Icons and it helped me to implement on my code. As you can see the layout of my Portfolio this is my creativity. 
                            I used Figma to Design the wireframe for my Website.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Coloring</h2>
                        <p>
                            In my Website I have used the color combinition of mainly brown color, light brown, dark brown etc.
                            <br> - I used #e9d9c7 as my backgroud color.
                            <br> - For Side-bar I used #20201a this color.
                            <br> - For some Text I used #474130 and #e9d9c7 according to the backgroud color, where text would be visible.
                            <br> I choosed this color because it makes my website user friendly and I wanted to go with the Old-money aesthetic vibe.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Font -->
                        <h3>Font</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have used 'didot-2', serif for my font in my website, as it matches the vibe of my website and the color.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Navigation or side bar and layout Section -->
                        <h3>Navigation and layout</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have made floating navgation bar at left side of my website which is also known side bar.
                            For my Layout I have made a glass like box usign opacity and box-shadow, where I have adde some shapes at backgroud which can be seen in blur effect. 
                            <br> In responsive to mobile my side bar will use hamburger effect so that while opening on mobile it won't look compact. 
                            While using hamburger we can utilize the remaining area to make clean design for mobiles. 
                            <br> I have added Hover effects on my layout like on the buttons where user can click and interact. 
                            while using hover I have added transition to make the hover look smooth.
                        </p>

                            <br>I used Breakpoint at 700xp and 1100px so that we can view from any kind of phones. CSS Grid was used for main layout, which made it easy to make responsive for mobile, Flex box for components alignmnets.
